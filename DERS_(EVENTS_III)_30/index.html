        HTML Events An HTML event can be something the browser does, or
        something a user does. Here are some examples of HTML events: An HTML
        web page has finished loading An HTML input field was changed An HTML
        button was clicked Often, when events happen, you may want to do
        something. JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.
        HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added
        to HTML elements.
